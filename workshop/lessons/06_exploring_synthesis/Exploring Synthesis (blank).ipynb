    "- _\"The solid state synthesis of YMnO3 requires very long procedure with repeated heating and grinding\" Z. Brankovic et al. Ceramics International 41 (2015)_\n",
    "- _\"There are still challenges to be addressed with respect to hydrothermal synthesis of h-YMnO3, most notably the difficulty in synthesising phase pure h-YMnO3. This is a result of the complexity of the system, with a total of eight crystalline phases having been detected throughout the course of the reaction.\" Marshall et al., Chem Eur.
