    "The tetragonal SiO$_2$ polymorph $\\alpha$-cristobalite is one of the very few crystalline materials known to have a negative average Poisson's ratio, which means that its cross-section expands under tensile strain rather than contracting. This property can be extremely useful in a variety of applications such as scratch-resistant coatings and high-toughness ceramics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why does $\\alpha$-cristobalite exhibit this property while other materials do not? The prevailing hypothesis is that $\\alpha$-cristobalite's negative Poisson's ratio is a result of its crystal structure. If that's the case, then perhaps we can find other materials with this exotic property by looking for materials with similar structures and then calculating their Poisson's ratios."
